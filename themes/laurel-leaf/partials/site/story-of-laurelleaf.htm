		<h3>The Story about the Laurel Leaf</h3>
		<p>The original Laurel Leaf pub, formerly known
			as Molloy´s wine bar, was located in Falls road,
			West Belfast.
			The Laurel Leaf at this stage was frequented by
			political hardliners and nobody was really
			surprised, when the bar was bombed out on
		Paddy´s day 1973.</p>
